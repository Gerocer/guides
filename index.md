# Welcome to the PixiJS Guides!

PixiJS is an open source, web-based rendering system that provides blazing fast
performance for games, data visualization, and other graphics intensive projects.

These guides are designed to be a companion to the [API documentation]({{ site.data.links.pixi-api }}), providing a
structured introduction to using the API to solve problems and build projects.

## Organization

The guides are split into three sections:

* **Basics** - Learn how to set up and use PixiJS, with discussion of common objects such as Sprites and Text, as well as a thorough walk through of the application lifecycle.
* **Production** - Information on optimization, deployment, and common issues encountered when moving from prototypes to production-ready code.
* **Advance Topics** - Standalone articles exploring advanced features of the API.

If you're new to PixiJS, we suggest you start with the Basics and read through them in order.  While PixiJS has a mature API and solid documentation, the guides go over many common issues and questions that developers new to the system encounter.

If you're a PixiJS veteran, you'll find the collected wisdom of our dev team in the Production section of the guides to help you take your projects to the next level of scalability and performance.  The Advanced section can offer inspiration and how-tos for pushing your games to the limit and adding cutting-edge visual effects.
